# Why
This is a nice picture for presentations for people who do not know a lot of microservices, container, orchestration.
I use it as one of the last agenda points as the big picture in the end of an overview presentation, where microservices, container and orchestration are explained. In this case the target audience is operations.
The goal is to get the teams, that deploy and operate the software, Security and Infrastrucutre to find themselfes in the cloud infrastrucutre world to erase fear and give them the possibility to take the next steps.

# What do the people have to know?
The people have to know on a really high level what a microservices, docker, kubernetes(pods, deployments, ingress) is.
